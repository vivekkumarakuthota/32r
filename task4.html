        html is a language.Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language
        [a] for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
        It defines the content and structure of web content.

    <u><h1> Elements </h1></u>
    the combination of opening and closing with content between the 
    tags is known as elements 
        <u><h2>types of elements</h2></u>
        <p> Elements are three types <br>
            1.Block level element <br>
            2.inline-block element <br>
            3.inline element
            <h2> 1.Block level element: </h2>
            the tag which occupies whole width and creates a new line.
                <br> ex: h1,h6,p,div,semantic elements etc.
                <h2> 2.Inline-block element: </h2>
                the elements which occupies only required space does not create newline 
                and we can apply width, height, margin and padding.<br> 
                ex:img,iframe,input,button etc.
                <h2> 3.Inline element</h2>
                the elements which occupies only required space and does not create new line 
                in css, we cannot apply width height,padding  top and bottom and margin top and bottom.<br>
                ex: span, formatting tags, b, strong etc.

            <h2><u> Agile methodologies </u></h2>Agile methodology is a project 
            management framework that breaks projects down into several 
            dynamic phases, commonly known as sprints. 
            The Agile framework is an iterative methodology.<br> 
            After every sprint, teams reflect and look back to see 
            if there was anything that could be improved so they can 
            adjust their strategy for the next sprint.

            <h2><u>water methodologies</u></h2>The Waterfall methodology — also known as the Waterfall model — 
            is a sequential development process that flows like a waterfall through all phases of a 
            project (analysis, design, development, and testing, for example), with each phase completely
            wrapping up before the next phase begins.The success of the Waterfall method depends on the 
            amount and quality of the work done on the front end, documenting everything in advance, including 
            the user interface, user stories, and all the features’ variations and outcomes.
            <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/waterfall-model/"><img src="water fall.webp" width="400" height="400"> </a><br>
            <h2><u>spiriall modal </u></h2>The Spiral Model is one of the most important Software Development Life 
            Cycle models.The Spiral Model is a combination of the waterfall model and the iterative model.
            It provides support for Risk Handling. The Spiral Model was first proposed by Barry Boehm.

            <h2><u> veification balance modal </u></h2>The V-model is a type of SDLC model where the process executes 
            sequentially in a V-shape. It is also known as the Verification and Validation model. It is based on the 
            association of a testing phase for each corresponding development stage. The development of each step is 
            directly associated with the testing phase. The next phase starts only after completion of the previous 
            phase i.e., for each development activity, there is a testing activity corresponding to it.

            <img src="vmodal.webp" width="250" height="250"></a> <br>
            <h2><u> software development life cycle (SDLC)</u></h2>The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is 
            the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build 
            high-quality software. The goal of SDLC is to minimize project risks through forward planning so 
            that software meets customer expectations during production and beyond. This methodology outlines 
            a series of steps that divide the software development process into tasks you can assign, complete,
            and measure.<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-development-life-cycle-sdlc/">
                <img src="SDLC-stages.png" width="250" height="250"></a> <br>
            <h2><u> Devops </u></h2>DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy that 
            automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT teams. 
            It emphasizes team empowerment, cross-team communication and collaboration, and technology 
            automation.Because of the continuous nature of DevOps, practitioners use the infinity loop to 
            show how the phases of the DevOps lifecycle relate to each other. Despite appearing to flow
            sequentially, the loop symbolizes the need for constant collaboration and iterative improvement 
            throughout the entire lifecycle.<br>he DevOps lifecycle consists of eight phases representing the
            processes, capabilities, and tools needed for development (on the left side of the loop) and 
            operations (on the right side of the loop). Throughout each phase, teams collaborate and 
            communicate to maintain alignment, velocity, and quality.
